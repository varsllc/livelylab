# Lively Lab
This repository hosts demo code for tutorial videos produced by Lively Lab. 

Each demo in this repo only contains the necessary scripts to complete a task. In other words, if you are developing a React web application, we can only provide sample code for a specific feature not the entire application. In most cases, we will have the App.js where you configure the component as well as the Component.js.
